# Notes by Aaditya Bhatnagar  
## *Zero to Production in Rust* — Luca Palmieri

These notes document my learnings while working through **Zero to Production in Rust** by Luca Palmieri. 

They include:
- key concepts explained in my own words  
- practical commands, tools, and workflows  
- additional context I researched to fill knowledge gaps  

⚠️ Disclaimer: Everything mentioned here are things I would want to remember in the future so I'm noting them down in first-person and not in third person because its a pain writing "The book mentions..." repeatedly. I claim no credit to any of the content in these notes. All my learning in these notes have come through the book and internet. These notes are not meant as a substitute to the book and are no means infringing on the book's content or replacing the book. This is intended purely for my personal understanding and is no different from notes made in a notebook for an exam. However, you free to look at my interpretation and understanding of the book in the free common open-source content space. Better safe than sorry 🙂

⚠️ Some basic steps (Rust install, Git setup, etc.) are intentionally omitted.  
If you feel stuck, **refer back to the book** — these notes are a companion, not a replacement.

## Chapter 1 — Getting Started

This chapter focuses on setting up the development environment and tooling.  
The steps are straightforward, so I won’t repeat them here, but I’ll highlight **useful tools and workflows** introduced early on.

---

### Useful Crates & Commands

- `cargo watch`  
  > *(macOS)* Installed via `brew install cargo-watch`  
  > `cargo install cargo-watch` caused ARM64 linker errors for me

- `cargo check`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo test`
- `cargo tarpaulin`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo fmt`
- `cargo audit`

---

### Inner Development Loop (IDL)

The **Inner Development Loop** represents how fast you can iterate while building software.

**Typical loop:**
1. Make a change
2. Compile the app
3. Run tests
4. Run the application

**Key idea:**  
> The speed of your IDL is an *upper bound* on how many meaningful iterations you can complete per hour.

Even though Rust produces fast binaries, **compile time becomes a bottleneck** on large projects.  
Optimizing your workflow to reduce unnecessary recompilation is critical.

---

### Continuous Integration (CI)

A **CI pipeline** automatically checks your code on every commit to ensure it is:
- buildable
- correct
- idiomatic
- secure

This prevents broken or low-quality code from reaching `main`, especially in team projects.

#### Typical CI Steps

1. **Run tests**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

2. **Code coverage**

    ```bash
    cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
    ```

    Helps identify untested or neglected areas of the codebase.

3. **Linting**

    ```bash
    cargo clippy -- -D warnings
    ```

    * catches unidiomatic or inefficient code
    * warnings can be silenced selectively using:
    
    ```rust
    #[allow(clippy::lint_name)]
    ```

4. **Formatting**

    ```bash
    cargo fmt -- --check
    ```

5. **Security audit**

    ```bash
    cargo audit
    ```

You can build your own pipeline or reuse existing ones.

## Chapter 2 — Building an Email Newsletter

The book clearly defines the **use case** through three core user stories.

### User Stories

* **As a blog visitor**
    I want to subscribe to the newsletter to receive updates when new content is published.

* **As a blog author**
    I want to email all subscribers when new content is published.

* **As a subscriber**
    I want to unsubscribe to stop receiving emails.

### Future Features (Not Implemented)

* Multiple newsletters
* Subscriber segmentation
* Open / click tracking

---

### Working in Iterations

* Each iteration has a **fixed timebox**
* Each iteration produces a **production-quality improvement**
* No “temporary” code — quality is enforced early

This mirrors real-world backend development.

---

## Chapter 3 — Signing Up a New Subscriber

This chapter introduces:

* the first HTTP endpoint
* database integration
* SQLx
* Docker + Postgres
* integration testing
* CI integration

⚠️ This chapter is **intentionally overwhelming** on the first read.

Repetition is expected.

---

### High-Level Flow

```
Blog Visitor
    ↓
Web Form (email + name)
    ↓
POST /subscriptions
    ↓
Backend Server
    ↓
Database (Postgres)
    ↓
HTTP Response
```

This chapter focuses **only on the backend**:

* `/subscriptions` `POST` endpoint
* Postgres Database connections to store the user's name and email
* CI pipeline, taking care of migrations

---

### Strategy Decisions

#### Web Framework

* Chosen: **actix-web**
* Alternatives: Rocket, Tide, Warp

📖 Framework comparison by the author:

---

#### Testing Strategy

Rust supports multiple testing approaches:

1. **Embedded tests**

    ```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    ```

    * hidden behind conditional compilation
    * good for testing internal components
    * suitable for “iceberg projects” (large internals, small public API)

2. **Integration tests** *(used in this project)*

    * placed in the `tests/` directory
    * simulate real user behavior
    * test the system as a whole

3. **Documentation tests**

We use **integration tests** because they validate real HTTP behavior.

📖 Useful references:

* Conditional compilation (`cfg`):

* Testing attributes:
  [https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/testing.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/testing.html)

---

### Database Integration

* Database: **Postgres**
* Crate: **sqlx**
* Migrations: **sqlx migrations**
* Queries validated at compile-time

---

### Side Quest — Docker Basics

#### Image vs Container

* **Image**

    * blueprint / template
    * immutable
    * like a *class*

```bash
docker pull postgres:latest
docker run postgres
```

* **Container**

    * running instance of an image
    * holds state (DB data, logs, files)
    * like an *object*

```bash
docker start <container_name>
docker ps
```

---

#### Useful Docker Commands

Inspect a container:

```bash
docker inspect <container_name>
```

Enter a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> bash
```

Inside Postgres:

```bash
psql -U postgres
\l
\c newsletter
\dt
\d subscriptions
SELECT * FROM subscriptions;
```

---

#### Dockerfile (Preview)

A **Dockerfile** is a recipe for building your own image.

It allows you to:

* define OS, dependencies, binaries
* build reproducible environments
* deploy consistently across machines

### First Endpoint: /health_check

We use /health_check to check the status of our application, whether its running or not. This can be combined with [pingdom.com](https://www.pingdom.com/) to alert when the API goes out of commision. It can also be combined with a container orchestrator like Kubernetes or Nomad to detect if the API is unresponsive and trigger a restart.
